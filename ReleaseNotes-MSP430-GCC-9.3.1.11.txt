GCC
* Fixed use of the "persistent" attribute always being reported invalid
  for C++ programs.
* Fixed "location" attribute still being applied when misused.
* Fixed prologue and epilogue of __mspabi_mpyll hardware multiply
  library function for f5series and 32bit hwmult devices not
  saving/restoring the full contents of some general purpose registers.
* Fixed errors when using the C++ numeric_limits class template with
  __int20 in constant expressions.
* Added -muse-430x-for-mem option to force the compiler to generate
  430X instructions when addressing memory operands.
* Updated hard-coded MSP430 MCU data to v1.210 of the MSP430-GCC Support
  Files.

Binutils
* Fixed incorrect linker shuffling of ".either" sections when an output
  section description from the linker script has no assignment
  expressions in it.
* Fixed objdump "section size is larger than file size" error when
  trying to disassemble programs with large .bss sections.
* Fixed the linker creating empty ELF segments in executable files
  containing empty .bss sections.

GDB
* The simulator executable (msp430-elf-run) now detects and reports stack
  overflow.

Newlib (C Library)
* Homogenized upper and lower memory regions of simulator linker script.
  -msim-rom-model can be used to select the old simulator linker script for
  -mlarge, which followed the ROM program model, where read/write data is
  initialized at run time instead of load time.
